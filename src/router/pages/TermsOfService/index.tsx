        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Services include the 0xKYC check, which is a zero-knowledge proof
        check and verification of End-Users’ identity, the result of which is
        minted into a non-transferable identity verification “Soulbound” token
        (the “<strong>Identity Token</strong>”) and made available on the
        decentralized blockchain network, and Sunscreen, which is a service that
        lets End-Users get a UUID based on a selfie or another biometric
        verification method. In order for the 0xKYC identity verification
        services to be provided, End-User will be required to provide certain
        information 0xKYC through our identity verification partners for us to
        Provide the Services, including an email address (on an optional basis),
        means of identification and a selfie photograph and End-User will be
        required respond to verification questions specifically about End-User’s
        country (and in the case of potentially sanctioned countries, End-User
        may be asked to provide an address). With regard to Sunscreen, the UUID is
        generated on the basis of biometric verification (a selfie, a 3D scan or
        otherwise). Sunscreen is currently an integral part of the 0xKYC identity
        verification service and may be provided as a standalone opt-in service
        in the future. With Sunscreen, we generate a UUID which is a string of
        characters that can be used to identify a user across different Web3
        wallets on the basis of the UUID.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Services do not disclose any Personal Data of End-Users, other than
        the Shared Data (as defined below). Shared Data will be publicly
        available and visible to all users of the blockchain by virtue of the
        Identity Token. The information recorded on the Identity Token and made
        available on the blockchain will confirm that an End-User meets the
        following specific criteria - (i) End-User is 18 years old or older,
        (ii) End-User is not subject to any OFAC sanctions or any other
        sanctions, and (iii) End-User’s wallet is not sanctioned and does not
        contain any suspicious funds ((i) to (ii) together the “
        <strong>Shared Data</strong>”). This confirmation will be expressed in
        concise affirmations (e.g., "yes" or “green checkmarks”) without
        disclosing any personally identifiable information of the End-Users.
      </p>
      <p>
        By accepting our Terms, you acknowledge that we do not generate the full
        scope of data required to establish a contractual relationship between
        the End-User and any third parties. As a result, a client-user or other
        form of contractual relationship may not be established solely based on
        our KYC check.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Services are only available in jurisdictions where such Services are
        legally permissible and the documents provided by you must be of
        sufficient quality to be verified with our selected method, usually this
        means they must show signs of strong security features. However, we put
        utmost care in serving all eligible customers; therefore, we try to
        provide Services for almost all available passports around the world.

          4. <span className="title"> Non-Reliance Basis of the Services </span>
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        By accepting these Terms and using the Services, you acknowledge and
        agree as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          {" "}
          Non-Reliance Basis: Our check is conducted on a non-reliance basis.
          This means that you cannot establish a client-user relationship solely
          based on our check. The check we perform does not serve as a
          comprehensive assessment of an End-User’s identity or compliance with
          regulations.
        </li>
        <li>
          {" "}
          No Substitute for Comprehensive KYC Verification: The check we provide
          is not a substitute for a full KYC service. Our check is limited to
          issuing proof of compliance with specific AML criteria based on the
          information available to us. You should therefore not solely rely on
          our check to establish a contractual or client-user relationship or
          for a comprehensive verification of an individual's identity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Risk-Based Approach: Our check is aligned with a risk-based approach
          as part of our commitment to AML compliance. It helps identify
          potential risks by assessing certain aspects such as the presence of
          suspicious funds, compliance with sanctions, and age verification.
          However, it should be noted that this check does not guarantee
          complete elimination of all AML risks.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is the responsibility of the clients to understand and adhere to
          the limitations and implications of our check.

        As noted above, we assign each End-User a UUID upon successful

          sufficient to permit us to locate the material;

          Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the
          complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if

        A notification that does not comply with all the above-mentioned
        requirements may not be valid. If you believe that a notice was wrongly
        filed against you, under the DMCA, you may file a counter-notice to our

        We are responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and
        discharge of any intellectual property infringement relating to the
        Services. It is often difficult to determine if your intellectual
        property rights have been violated or if the DMCA requirements have been
        met. We may request additional information before we remove any
        infringing material. If a dispute develops as to the correct owner of
        the rights in question, we reserve the right to remove your content
        along with that of the alleged infringer pending resolution of the
        matter. 0xKYC will provide you with notice if your materials have been
        removed based on a third-party complaint of alleged infringement of the
        third-party's intellectual property rights.

        BY ANY COPYRIGHT OWNER'S LICENSEE THAT IS INJURED AS A RESULT OF
