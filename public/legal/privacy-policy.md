By using our Services, you agree to the collection and use of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Capitalized terms have the same meaning as in the Terms of Service.

Our Clients and data suppliers may have a separate relationship with you and may have lawful reasons to process your Personal Data. Your Personal Data is collected and processed by them separately, and they are required to provide you with information about this (for example, in their own privacy notice).

**2. <span class="title"> What Personal Data do we collect and why? </span>**

<td>You share your personal identifiers with us and/or our trusted third-party partners so that we can verify your identity.
We will collect and further process those personal identifiers either directly or through our trusted third-party partners, for the purpose of generating an identity token that verifies that you are at least 18 years of age, you are not from a sanctioned country and your wallet is not sanctioned nor contains suspicious funds, this identity token can facilitate your online transactions, prove uniqueness, prevent identity theft and fraudulent activity. </td>

<td>Your identity wallet address and Universal Unique Identity Number (UUID).</td>
<td>Although you may not actively provide us with this information, we will utilize your wallet address from the publicly available blockchain data for the purpose of providing our Services.
We use this information to establish trust and provide you with a Universal Unique Identifier Number (UUID), which will represent you across the internet, and may be linked to more than one wallet. Your UUID is user-owned, though we will make this information available on the blockchain and this will be linked to your wallet and accessible to all users of the blockchain.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Biometric information, such as hair color, eye color, and other biometric data obtained from photos provided by you or available in your documents.</td>
<td>You share with us and/or our trusted third-party partners this information to enable our products to function and authenticate ID documents, proving the uniqueness of the individual while using a minimum set of data in the most privacy-preserving manner possible.
We will only collect the biometric information we need for the purpose of providing our Services. Your biometric information will only be used and maintained for lawful purposes directly related to our Services. Its retention by us and our trusted third-party partners is limited to the initial purpose for collecting or obtaining such identifiers or information and is not stored by us, except where required by any applicable data retention laws and shall be subject to any maximum retention periods specified in applicable laws.

<span class="bold"> How to Submit a Request </span>

To submit an access or deletion request, contact us at support@0xkyc.id. All requests must be labelled “California Access/Removal Request” on the email subject line or post. All requests must state that you personally posted such content and provide a description of the content or information you want removed and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate such content or information. We are not responsible for notices that are not labelled or sent properly, and we may not be able to respond if you do not provide adequate information. Please allow 30 days for a response. To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we may take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with your request. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request. Additionally, in some circumstances, such as if you request that we delete your data, we may not be able to complete a request for a good or service because we will not have the required information to deliver it.

<span class="bold"> CHOICE/OPT-OUT MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS FROM US, EMAIL, PHONE, COOKIES. </span>

You always have the opportunity to opt out of our marketing communications (if any) with you or change your preferences by emailing us at support@0xkyc.id or by using the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of a marketing email to opt out of receiving future emails. Some communications from us are considered transactional or service communications, and our Services are provided to you upon the condition that you receive these communications from us. You must cancel your account and/or order for our Services, as applicable, if you do not wish to receive any transactional or service communications.

<span class="bold"> CHANGES </span>

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
Please note that although you have a right to request deletion or erasure of your Personal Data under the applicable laws set forth above, once the Identity Token is minted, we are no longer able to delete it from the decentralized network. We may only be able to change the status from active to inactive. By using our Services and agreeing to our Terms and Privacy Policy, you acknowledge and agree that a request for deletion will result in a change of the status of the Identity Token from ‘active’ to ‘inactive’ and not a deletion of the Identity Token itself.

<span class="bold"> Local country laws outside the United States, United Kingdom, or Europe:</span>

Our global headquarters are in the United States, but we may have customers that operate around the world to provide our Services. Where we transfer your Personal Data to a country that does not provide adequate data protection legislation, we will ensure that it is protected and transferred in a manner consistent with legal requirements applicable to the jurisdiction and classification of information, such as with the EU’s Standard Contractual Clauses.

**9. <span class="title"> Opt-in for UUIDs on the Blockchain </span>**

As part of our Services, we may assign a Unique Identifier (UUID) to each End-User for the purpose of identity verification. To ensure compliance with privacy regulations and provide transparency, prior to recording the UUID on the blockchain, we may request explicit consent from you. By opting in to place the UUID on the blockchain, the End-User understands and agrees that the UUID will be publicly available and visible to all users of the blockchain. This allows for proof of identity within our services and enhances trust and transparency. It is important to note that opting in to place the UUID on the blockchain is not mandatory and is solely based on the End-User’s preference.

End-Users have the right to revoke their consent. Please be aware that once the Identity Token is minted on the decentralized network, it cannot be deleted, as the blockchain technology does not allow for data deletion. While you have the right to request the deletion or erasure of your Personal Data as permitted by applicable laws, it is important to understand that we can only modify the status of the Identity Token from ‘active’ to ‘inactive’. By using our Services and agreeing to our Terms and Privacy Policy, you acknowledge and accept that a request for deletion will result in a change of the status of the Identity Token rather than the actual deletion of the Identity Token itself.

**10. <span class="title"> Biometric Information Privacy Rights. </span>**

<span class="bold"> Statement and Consent. </span>

As a company, we recognize the importance of biometric information, and we take our obligations to ensure its confidentiality and security seriously. That is why we have partnered with Onfido, a market-leader and trusted third-party service provider, to process identity checks.

Onfido may collect, retain, and use your biometric information through photos of identity documents, selfies or videos. Onfido runs identity checks by comparing facial scan data extracted from your identity document photo with facial scan data extracted from your selfie photo or video, and as a result can verify your identity, authenticate you as a user, or prevent fraud or identity theft.

The Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act ("**BIPA**"), regulates the collection, storage, use, and retention of "biometric identifiers" and "biometric information." "Biometric identifier" means a retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or scan of hand or face geometry. "Biometric information" means any information, regardless of how it is captured, converted, stored, or shared, based on an individual's biometric identifier used to identify an individual.
[Privacy Policy](https://app.0xkyc.id/privacy-policy)
Your biometric information will not be collected or otherwise obtained by us without your prior consent. Prior to using our Services, you will need to understand and accept the [Onfido Facial Scan Policy and Release](https://onfido.com/facial-scan-policy-and-release/), [Onfido Privacy Policy](https://onfido.com/privacy/), and [Onfido Terms of Service](https://onfido.com/terms-of-service/and). You can decline to provide biometric identifiers and biometric information to us and/or trusted third-party providers, though you will not be able to use our Services without this feature. You may revoke this consent at any time by notifying us at support@0xkyc.id.

<span class="bold"> Storage and Retention Schedule.</span>

Though the biometric information will be collected and stored by our trusted third-party service providers and not by us, in circumstances where we are required to retain biometric information, we will use a reasonable standard of care to collect, transmit and protect from disclosure any biometric information collected. Storage, transmission, and protection from disclosure shall be performed in a manner that is the same as or more protective than the manner in which we store, transmit and protect from disclosure other confidential and sensitive information that is used to uniquely identify an individual.

Additionally, unless required otherwise by law, in circumstances in which we retain biometric information, we will retain such information only until, and shall request that its trusted third-party service providers permanently destroy such information, when the first of the following occurs:

<ol>
<li>
The initial purpose for collecting or obtaining biometric information has been satisfied.
</li>
<li>
Within one (1) year of the individual's last interaction with us.
</li>
</ol>

**11. <span class="title"> Exercise your rights. </span>**

We have not reviewed third-party websites’ policies, are not responsible for the content or practices, and you access and use them at your own risk. Please contact the third-party sites directly for information on their privacy policies and practices.

**13. <span class="title"> Children's Privacy </span>**

Our Portal and Services are not intended for use by individuals under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under 18. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from a child under 18, we will take steps to delete such information as soon as possible. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to us through are site, please contact us at [support@0xkyc.id](mailto:support@0xkyc.id) and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.

**14. <span class="title"> Changes to This Privacy Policy </span>**

We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy from time to time, in our sole discretion. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on our website. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
