        or regulatory reasons. Please note that although you have a right to

        able to change the status from active to inactive. By using our Services
        and agreeing to our Terms and Privacy Policy, you acknowledge and agree
        that a request for deletion will result in a change of the status of the
        Identity Token from ‘active’ to ‘inactive’ and not a deletion of the
        Identity Token itself.

        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of our Services, we may assign a Unique Identifier (UUID) to
        each End-User for the purpose of identity verification. To ensure
        compliance with privacy regulations and provide transparency, prior to
        recording the UUID on the blockchain, we may request explicit consent
        from you. By opting in to place the UUID on the blockchain, the End-User
        understands and agrees that the UUID will be publicly available and
        visible to all users of the blockchain. This allows for proof of
        identity within our services and enhances trust and transparency. It is
        important to note that opting in to place the UUID on the blockchain is
        not mandatory and is solely based on the End-User’s preference.
      </p>
      <p>
        End-Users have the right to revoke their consent. Please be aware that
        once the Identity Token is minted on the decentralized network, it
        cannot be deleted, as the blockchain technology does not allow for data
        deletion. While you have the right to request the deletion or erasure of
        your Personal Data as permitted by applicable laws, it is important to
        understand that we can only modify the status of the Identity Token from
        ‘active’ to ‘inactive’. By using our Services and agreeing to our Terms
        and Privacy Policy, you acknowledge and accept that a request for
        deletion will result in a change of the status of the Identity Token
        rather than the actual deletion of the Identity Token itself.

        As a company, we recognize the importance of biometric information, and
        we take our obligations to ensure its confidentiality and security
        seriously. That is why we have partnered with Onfido, a market-leader
        and trusted third-party service provider, to process identity checks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Onfido may collect, retain, and use your biometric information through
        photos of identity documents, selfies or videos. Onfido runs identity
        checks by comparing facial scan data extracted from your identity
        document photo with facial scan data extracted from your selfie photo or
        video, and as a result can verify your identity, authenticate you as a
        user, or prevent fraud or identity theft.

        The Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act ("<strong>BIPA</strong>

        identifiers" and "biometric information." "Biometric identifier" means a
        retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or scan of hand or face
        geometry. "Biometric information" means any information, regardless of
        how it is captured, converted, stored, or shared, based on an
        individual's biometric identifier used to identify an individual. Your
        biometric information will not be collected or otherwise obtained by us

      <p>
        Additionally, unless required otherwise by law, in circumstances in
        which we retain biometric information, we will retain such information
        only until, and shall request that its trusted third-party service
        providers permanently destroy such information, when the first of the
