**3. <span class="title"> Description of Services </span>**

Our Services include the 0xKYC check, which is a zero-knowledge proof check and verification of End-Users’ identity, the result of which is minted into a non-transferable identity verification “Soulbound” token (the “Identity Token”) and made available on the decentralized blockchain network, and 1Vote, which is a service that lets End-Users get a UUID based on a selfie or another biometric verification method. In order for the 0xKYC identity verification services to be provided, End-User will be required to provide certain information 0xKYC through our identity verification partners for us to Provide the Services, including an email address (on an optional basis), means of identification and a selfie photograph and End-User will be required respond to verification questions specifically about End-User’s country (and in the case of potentially sanctioned countries, End-User may be asked to provide an address). With regard to 1Vote, the UUID is generated on the basis of biometric verification (a selfie, a 3D scan or otherwise). 1Vote is currently an integral part of the 0xKYC identity verification service and may be provided as a standalone opt-in service in the future. With 1Vote, we generate a UUID which is a string of characters that can be used to identify a user across different Web3 wallets on the basis of the UUID.

Our Services do not disclose any Personal Data of End-Users, other than the Shared Data (as defined below). Shared Data will be publicly available and visible to all users of the blockchain by virtue of the Identity Token. The information recorded on the Identity Token and made available on the blockchain will confirm that an End-User meets the following specific criteria - (i) End-User is 18 years old or older, (ii) End-User is not subject to any OFAC sanctions or any other sanctions, and (iii) End-User’s wallet is not sanctioned and does not contain any suspicious funds ((i) to (ii) together the “Shared Data”). This confirmation will be expressed in concise affirmations (e.g., "yes" or “green checkmarks”) without disclosing any personally identifiable information of the End-Users.

By accepting our Terms, you acknowledge that we do not generate the full scope of data required to establish a contractual relationship between the End-User and any third parties. As a result, a client-user or other form of contractual relationship may not be established solely based on our KYC check.

Our Services are only available in jurisdictions where such Services are legally permissible and the documents provided by you must be of sufficient quality to be verified with our selected method, usually this means they must show signs of strong security features. However, we put utmost care in serving all eligible customers; therefore, we try to provide Services for almost all available passports around the world.

For more information on our commitment to End-User privacy and data protection practices, please review our [Privacy Policy](https://app.0xkyc.id/privacy-policy).

**4. <span class="title"> Non-Reliance Basis of the Services </span>**

By accepting these Terms and using the Services, you acknowledge and agree as follows:

Non-Reliance Basis: Our check is conducted on a non-reliance basis. This means that you cannot establish a client-user relationship solely based on our check. The check we perform does not serve as a comprehensive assessment of an End-User’s identity or compliance with regulations.
No Substitute for Comprehensive KYC Verification: The check we provide is not a substitute for a full KYC service. Our check is limited to issuing proof of compliance with specific AML criteria based on the information available to us. You should therefore not solely rely on our check to establish a contractual or client-user relationship or for a comprehensive verification of an individual's identity.
Risk-Based Approach: Our check is aligned with a risk-based approach as part of our commitment to AML compliance. It helps identify potential risks by assessing certain aspects such as the presence of suspicious funds, compliance with sanctions, and age verification. However, it should be noted that this check does not guarantee complete elimination of all AML risks.
It is the responsibility of the clients to understand and adhere to the limitations and implications of our check.

**(B) INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT AND DMCA COMPLIANCE**

You shall not post content or use the Services for any purpose that infringes on a third party’s intellectual property rights, and we may remove any such content, without prior notice to you. Please notify us if you are aware of any intellectual property right infringement by a user of our Services. In compliance with Section 512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “**DMCA**”), we designate the following individual to receive any notifications of an alleged infringement:
Copyright Agent: Dylan Wysocki
An effective notification should include:
A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;
Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material;
Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted;
A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

A notification that does not comply with all the above-mentioned requirements may not be valid. If you believe that a notice was wrongly filed against you, under the DMCA, you may file a counter-notice to our designated individual with the following information:
Your physical or electronic signature;
Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;
A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;
Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which we are located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which we may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification or an agent of such person.

We are responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any intellectual property infringement relating to the Services. It is often difficult to determine if your intellectual property rights have been violated or if the DMCA requirements have been met. We may request additional information before we remove any infringing material. If a dispute develops as to the correct owner of the rights in question, we reserve the right to remove your content along with that of the alleged infringer pending resolution of the matter. 0xKYC will provide you with notice if your materials have been removed based on a third-party complaint of alleged infringement of the third-party's intellectual property rights.

IF YOU KNOWINGLY MISREPRESENT THAT MATERIAL IS OR IS NOT INFRINGING, YOU MAY BE SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTIES. THESE INCLUDE MONETARY DAMAGES, COURT COSTS, AND ATTORNEYS' FEES INCURRED BY 0XKYC, BY ANY COPYRIGHT OWNER, OR BY ANY COPYRIGHT OWNER'S LICENSEE THAT IS INJURED AS A RESULT OF RELIANCE UPON YOUR MISREPRESENTATION. YOU MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL PROSECUTION FOR PERJURY. YOU AGREE WE MAY PROVIDE YOUR NOTICE TO THE PROVIDER OF THE ALLEGEDLY INFRINGING MATERIAL.

You and 0xKYC agree that each party will bear its own attorneys' fees and costs unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose.

**14. <span class="title"> Severability. </span>**

If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, legal, and enforceable, or if modification is not possible, then such provision shall be severed from these Terms.
